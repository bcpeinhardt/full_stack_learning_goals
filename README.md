# full_stack_learning_goals
I am taking the next step in advancing my software development skills. I am going to create a website which allows the user
to define their own notetaking shorthand, upload a configuration document and a notes document, and
get a translation. This project is inspired by my brother's fights with LaTeX 

This repository will eventually contain a full website. Here's what I mean by that
- A front end for easy use
- A back end built in Rust

Design and Development Process:
    Design the layout for the language semantics (find and replace, regex, etc.) | Complete
    Design the User Experience for configuring settings and translating notes.
    Design the API for the backend. | Complete
    Build the API and Database | Complete
    Build the Front End.
    Deploy via Docker.

Wish me luck!
