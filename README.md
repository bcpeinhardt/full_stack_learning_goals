# full_stack_learning_goals
I am taking the next step in advancing my software development skills. I am going to create a website which allows the user
to define their own notetaking shorthand, upload a configuration document and a notes document, and
get a translation. This project is inspired by my brother's fights with LaTeX 

This repository will eventually contain a full website. Here's what I mean by that
- A front end built in Elm
- A back end built in Rust
- A relational database (likely sqlite)

Design and Development Process:
    Design the layout for the language semantics (find and replace, regex, etc.)
    Design the User Experience for configuring settings and translating notes.
    Design the API for the backend.
    Build the API and Database.
    Build the Front End.

Wish me luck!
